# Computer Vision Automax - Technical Details

## Project Description

Computer Vision Automax is an advanced object detection and tracking system designed to automatically identify objects in video feeds. The project leverages modern computer vision techniques, including YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) for object detection and Roboflow for dataset management and annotation.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Collection and Preparation

1. **Video Acquisition**: Raw video footage is collected from various sources.
2. **Frame Extraction**: Using the `frame.py` utility, videos are processed to extract frames at a controlled rate (1/10 of the video's FPS).
3. **Data Annotation**: Frames are uploaded to Roboflow, where objects of interest are manually labeled using bounding boxes.
4. **Data Augmentation**: Roboflow applies transformations like rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustments to enhance the dataset's diversity.
5. **Dataset Export**: The annotated dataset is exported in YOLOv8-compatible format.

### Model Architecture

The project utilizes YOLOv8s (small variant), a state-of-the-art object detection model with the following characteristics:

- **Backbone**: CSPDarknet with Cross-Stage Partial connections
- **Neck**: PANet (Path Aggregation Network) for feature fusion
- **Head**: Decoupled detection heads for object classification and bounding box regression
- **Parameters**: ~11 million parameters
- **Input Size**: 640x640 pixels
- **Inference Speed**: Real-time performance on modern GPUs

### Training Methodology

1. **Transfer Learning**: The model is initialized with pre-trained weights from a model trained on the COCO dataset.
2. **Hyperparameters**:
   - Batch size: 16
   - Learning rate: 0.01 with a cosine schedule
   - Optimizer: SGD with momentum
   - Training epochs: 50
   - Image size: 640x640

3. **Data Split**:
   - Training set: 658 images
   - Validation set: 188 images

4. **Augmentation During Training**:
   - Random flipping
   - Scaling and shearing
   - HSV color space adjustments
   - Blur and CLAHE transformations

### Inference Pipeline

The inference process, implemented in `Predict.py`, involves:

1. **Video Input**: Loading a video stream from a file or camera
2. **Frame Processing**: Processing each frame through the trained YOLOv8 model
3. **Object Detection**: Detecting objects and their bounding boxes
4. **Visualization**: Drawing bounding boxes, confidence scores, and object counts on the output frames
5. **Output Generation**: Displaying the processed frames or saving them to a video file

## Performance Metrics

The model's performance is evaluated using standard object detection metrics:

- **mAP50 (mean Average Precision at IoU=0.5)**: ~0.98
- **Precision**: ~0.96
- **Recall**: ~0.97
- **F1-Score**: Calculated from precision and recall
- **Confusion Matrix**: Available in the results directory

## Visual Results

The project includes several demonstration videos showcasing the model's capabilities:

1. **Input Video** (`Input Videos/input.mp4`): The original, unprocessed video footage.

2. **Test Video with Results** (`Test Video/testvid.mp4`): This video demonstrates the model's detection capabilities with bounding boxes around detected objects, confidence scores, and an object counter. It serves as a visual proof of concept for the project's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

3. **Output Video** (`Output.mp4`): The final processed video that showcases the complete pipeline with all visualization features enabled. This video represents the end product of the computer vision system.

These videos provide concrete evidence of the model's performance and can be used for both demonstration and evaluation purposes. The visual feedback with real-time object counts and bounding boxes illustrates the practical applications of the technology.

## Use Cases

This computer vision system can be applied to various domains:

1. **Surveillance and Security**: Detecting and counting people or vehicles
2. **Manufacturing**: Quality control and defect detection
3. **Retail**: Customer counting and behavior analysis
4. **Traffic Monitoring**: Vehicle detection and traffic analysis
5. **Warehouse Management**: Inventory tracking and management

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for the project include:

1. **Multi-Class Detection**: Extending the model to detect multiple object classes
2. **Temporal Analysis**: Implementing object tracking across frames
3. **Edge Deployment**: Optimizing the model for edge devices
4. **UI Development**: Creating a user-friendly interface for non-technical users
5. **Cloud Integration**: Deploying the model as a cloud service with API access
